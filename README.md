# Fullstack repository

Hi! This is Carlos, from Colombia, in this repository you'll see an application created as a mock project to start working with JS, HTML, CSS.

## You may see an open source program that could be use as a template for your project

#### Keep in mind those recommendations:
* Make sure you have installed NodeJS and npm

>Start running the application using your command prompt 
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

#### Go to `localhost:8000` on your address bar to see the application running on your  web browser
